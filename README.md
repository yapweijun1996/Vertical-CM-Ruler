# Vertical CM Ruler

A vertical centimeter ruler built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project displays a precisely scaled vertical ruler on your screen (ensure your browser is at 100% zoom) and is great for design calibration or measurement testing.

## Features

- **Accurate Measurement:** Ruler scales such that 1cm on screen equals 1cm in real life.
- **Reversed Numbering:** The ruler displays the top value as the total length and counts down to 0.
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Adjust the ruler length using the input control.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile with orientation warnings for landscape mode.


## How It Works

- **Tick Marks:** Generates tick marks for each mm and every 10th tick is a major tick with a centimeter label.
- **Dynamic Height:** The height of the ruler is set in centimeters according to user input.
- **Orientation Checking:** Warns users to switch to portrait mode on narrow screens for best accuracy.
